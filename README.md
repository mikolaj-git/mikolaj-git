- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mikolaj. 

I associate my career future with the IT industry. Currently I am a Manual Tester, but my main goal is to work as an Automation Tester. As an employee, I am strongly motivated to constantly develop and expand my knowledge and experience. I am good at teamwork and I am always open to finding new solutions.

This is a link to my portfolio page - https://mikolaj-git.github.io/portfolio-react/. I've used this before when I wanted to become a front-end developer. Now my main goal is to be an automation tester, because that's what I like the most.
