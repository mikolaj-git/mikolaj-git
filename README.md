- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mikolaj. 

I associate my career future with the IT industry. I am currently a Manual Tester, but my main goal is to work as an Automation Tester. As an employee, I am highly motivated to continuously develop and expand my knowledge and experience. I find myself well in teamwork and am always open to finding new solutions.
